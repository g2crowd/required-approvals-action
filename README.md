GitHub Action to check JIRA story for labels matching a required/approved convention.

Primary use case for this is to prevent someone from merging a PR without external approval.
JIRA tags in a commit message or PR title is used to get labels on the issue and find matching pairs of labels.

The convention operates based on the `-required` and `-approved` suffixes and works with any content before that.
